Name one or two features you’d like to implement
No clicking on a square that has a value, change square color based on player X or O
How would you implement those features? Write 2–3 sentences per feature
For no double clicking: when clicked, check if the value is null, if not don't allow and don't update player
For color coding: just check who the player was and style accordingly.
